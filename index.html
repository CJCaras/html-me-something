	<h1>Headings(level 1)</h1>

    <ol>Rules for headings:

	    <li>The "!Doctype" tag tells the browser under what rules to interpret this page. Although,
		it still shows up properly when I remove it. Developers used to be required to write a lot of versions of
        HTML in the doctype tag with links to each.
	    <li>The "html tag" basically serves as an envelope for all the content that is to be interpreted as HTML. And it CAN contain
            the language attribute. The value has a 2-letter definition of the language, and it can be followed by another
            value for the dialect. This is for "screen accessibility apps" and search engines, not what languages will[not] display.
        <li>The "head" tag contains all the head elements including the "metadata tag/element".
        	Metadata typically contains the document title, scripts, links, character set, styles and other meta info that tell
        	search engines about your page. It doesn't have a closing tag, but a closing angle bracket before the tag ends.
        <li>The "body tag" element defines and holds the content that the user will read in the browser window.
	</ol>
    </p>

    <p title="headings">The "h" stands for heading and the "1" stands for size. There are 6 total sizes
	for a heading. Headings should only be used to seperate topics. If you want to make text big and bold but
	not as a heading, use other methods. Search engines use the headings to index and structure the content. The style
	attribute may be followed	by "color" or "background-color" or "font-family" or
	"font-size" or "text-align" among other things. But only one style per tag.<br>
	To be technically correct, we refer to the "<>" as tags but the type of tag as an element, e.g. the "paragraph element is
	represented by ... tag." But in practice, the words element and tag are often used interchangeably.
    </p>

    <h2 title="An H2 heading for ToC" style="color:red;">Paragraph elements and tags</h2>

    <p style="text-align:center;">
        There is a "double space" where the *paragraph tags* begin and end which sets it apart from single-spaced new line (br) tags.
		Whenever anything within a tag is given a value or address or something, the attribute is followed by an equal
		sign and the value is enclosed in quotations, e.g. name="value". Quotations
		are not <i>always</i> necessary, but sometimes they are and is therefore an important habit. Prefer double-quotes, but single
		quotes are also accepted and may be necessary if the value itself contains quotes, e.g. [name='say "hello" to me']. Also note
		that attributes are always in the opening tag.
		Here is a link to <a href="http://www.cair-mo.org" target="_blank">my work address</a>. "href" stands for "hypertext reference".
		Add the attribute "target=_blank" for the website to open in another window automatically.
		You can make words <b>(b)old</b> or <i>(i)talicized</i> with b or i tags. If it's important <strong>make it (strong)</strong>
		or <em>(em)phasize it with em</em>. You can <del>(del)ete</del> text, <ins>(ins)ert text</ins>, make it <sub>(sub)script</sub>
		 or <sup>(sup)erscript</sup>. You may <mark>(mark) text</mark> or even <small>make it (small)</small>. Browsers display strong
		as bold and emphasized same as italicized, but they carry semantic differences, and the "i" and "b" tags may
        not be read as desired with a screenreader. With a "style element" within a tag, -following
        style="property:value;" of CSS rules, you can change something, like color.</p>
		<p>

        <p>Note that "br" means break, or "line break" and needs no close UNLESS you are looking for a special validation
        	or for the site to be read by "XML parsers". It is the simplest kind of tag. It's "empty element" without an "end tag".
        	An element within an element is said to be "nested". Most elements are nested--within the html and body tags,
        	for example, just as an italicized word can be nested in an emboldened phrase. The element on the inside is called the
        	"child element" while the "parent element" is on the outside. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends 2 spaces
        	of indentation between nested elements.</p>

        <p title="tooltip">Note that paragraphs can be given "title attributes". If you do so,
        	then the title value will be displayed when the mouse hovers over that paragraph.
        	That's a title attribute. But the "head element" (before the body) encloses the "title element"
        	that indicates the title of the page as it's displayed on the browser tab. Only what is in
        	between the body tags will [always] show up on the page. </p>


			Browsers ignore extra spaces, lines and tabs. The way to get out of that, is with the <pre>"pre
form
atted" pre tag. The <b>font</b> will also be fixed-width (usually Courier).</pre>

    <br />Another way to add extra spaces between two &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp words is typing ampersand nbsp as many times as you want spaces.
    <br />
    </p>

    <p>
	To create this kind of doc, one could create a notepad doc, save it as a .html file, and at the bottom where it shows
		"encoding", choose UTF-8. I don't know how important that is though because I've only seen that instruction once.
    </p>

    <p>
	When you want to emphasize a specific (q)uote, <q>put it like this with the q tag</q>.
		But when you have a long quote, <blockquote>Using the (blockquote) tag will work and the browser should
		margin it appropriately. Something else neat... if you want longer text to show up when the mouse hovers over a word,
		then just like the paragraph title, the title attribute can be added to an (abbr)eviated word like
		<abbr title="Christopher John Caras">CJC</abbr>. You may also <cite>(cite) a Title of a Work</cite> to make it
		italicized. And then, the (bdo) tag with (dir) attribute and (rtl) value will <bdo dir="rtl">reverse textual direction
		</bdo> &nbsp in supporting browsers. That said: reverse textual direction.</blockquote>
    </p>

		<address>The address element will be given a linebreaking before and after, and italization.<br> Typically, you would
		add a linebreak between each line of the address, i.e. name, street, city, etc.</address>

		<h4>4TH LEVEL: IMAGES & COLORS</h4>

	<p>
	Elements without closing tags are called "self-closing" and should end with a forward slash /.
	Image elements begin with the *image tag "img"* [which is not "open/close" with two tags, unlike some others,
	because the image is one block, and not some text or other things kept within. The other type is called an "element".
	After "img" it is followed by the *source "src"* followed by the *alternative text "alt" which would be what a
	blind person hears when wanting to know what the image is or if it doesn't display correctly (a simple description
	basically, but not caption)* followed by *width* and *height*. Note that within tags, there's a space from one word/clause to the next.
	Let's try this image
    <br />
	<img src="images/taken.jpg" img-align="center" title="Sorry ladies, I'm taken." alt="Sorry ladies, I'm taken." height="300" width="200"></p>
	</p>
<br>

	<p>Admittedly, some end tags are not always needed. But best practices dictate remembering them.
	Some browsers, themes, etc may not display correctly if the tag is not ended properly.
	Empty elements can be closed inside the original tag with a space and then a slash.
    NOTE that tags can have upper/lower case attributes, values and definitions. There may be
	strict document types that demand lower case, so it is a good habit to keep.</p>

    <ol title="ordered list">Colors may be represented in one of three ways in HTML and CSS.
        <li>By stating the name of the color, e.g. red, black, magenta, powderblue, etc. HTML reads 140 different names.
        <li>By stating its Red Green Blue value, giving each of the three colors a number between 0 and 255 intensity. rgb(0,0,0) is black but
                rgb(255,255,255) is white. Red is rgb(255,0,0) and like that for green and blue.
        <li>Stating the "Hex[idecimal] Value" which is #RRGGBB and each color is represented by 2 digits 00 - FF. So red is #FF0000.
    </ol>

    <h6>Escape Characters</h6>

    <p title="Escape Characters">
	Some sets of characters can be used to represent a symbol for rendering in the browser. We already learned that to add extra
	spaces between characters, we have to write &amp;nbsp. But in order to make that symbol show up in the browser as an & with the letters,
	and not be rendered as an additional space, I had to write the code for the "&" symbol, which is &amp;amp, which, if written like that
	in my source file shows up as: &amp. Other character sets create different symbols. For example, Copyright &copy which is &amp;copy.
	And then Trademark &#8482 from &amp;#8482. Add a colon in between symbol sets when added together. The browser won't show the colon
	because the colon simply signifies the end of the browser. And then to get a question mark, we can type &amp;#63 which renders: &#63.
	Escape characters also allow us to type bent brackets without browser rendering. For example, +++++++ for italics. &amp;lt creates
	the first "lesser than" enclosing tag and &amp;gt the second "greater than".
